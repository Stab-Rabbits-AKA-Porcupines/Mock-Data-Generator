# Mock Data Generator

#### Uses in-house API to generate names, emails, phone numbers, countries, birthdays, coordinates, and URLs into textbox with copy button.

## Version 2.0 
- Used TDD to implement new datatypes and output options, check front-end rendering
- Designed React tests for rendering newly added datatypes (in 'frontend' branch with additional dependences differing from main branch) 
- Added new styling for more intuitive flow and readability
- JSON or CSV output options
- Added birthdays, coordinates, and URLs to datatypes
- refactored code, deleted unnecessary spread operations and temporary assignments

## Stretch Features: 
- Add a documentation page so users can use the api directly without our frontend
- Have data returned in order of selection
- Add dark mode

### Made with React.js, Express.js, vanilla CSS, jest, and Webpack
